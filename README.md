# Hi, I'm Bloodiko ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as IT-Specialist - System Integration. I like to experiment and to understand how software, tools and libraries work behind the scenes.
Usually I code only small scripts I need with Python, Bash, and now recently also with JavaScript and Typescript - including with Buns new Bash feature, as well as Deno. 
See my repositories for my playgound projects.
